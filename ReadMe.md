Creating Virtual Emulator
To run our app, you must first create an emulator by selecting menu “Tools => Device Manager” and choosing “Pixel 2.”
Once you click "Pixel 2," you must choose “Nougat API 24 Android 7.0 x86” when told to "Select a System Image."
Now your emulator is set up and you can run the app on your AVD by  clicking “Run ‘app’” command from the “Run” menu.

Now that our app is running on your virtual emulator, you must first create an account using your name and email.
You can also login with Google to use our application.
Also, if you create an account without logging in through Google and log in with Google the next time, our app will 
automatically merge the account login data so that you can use either login method to access your account.

Once you have created an account, you will be directed to create a profile which is mandatory. 
You will be required to put in your full name, email, gender, class standing, profile picture, and a biography.
All of these can be updated/edited at any time you would like.

Now that you have completed creating an account and profile, you will be directed to the invitations page.
On the invitations page, you can see a list of invitations you have received as well as the invitations you have sent.
You will also have the freedom to be able to create more invitations to send others as well as edit invitations you may have sent.
Some features of our app on the invitations page is that:
    1. Clicking on any part of the invitations card except for the buttons will create a popup to show you more information about
       an invitation that was sent to you.
    2. Clicking on the message button on the invitation card will create a popup, allowing you to message the user who invited you,
       indicating that you have accepted their invitation. This will remove all other invitations from your invitations page, except
       for the ones you have created.
    3. Clicking on the removed button on the invitation card will remove that invitation off your list of invites, indicating that
       you have rejected the invitation.
    4. You can also filter through your list of invites using the two dropdowns above which allow you to:
            1. Sort by Name, Gender, Class Standing, Distance in miles, Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, Price,
              and Maximum Number of Roommates.
            2. Sort the above in ascending and descending order.
            3. Search bar will allow you to put in an input depending on what you select from the list of filter types specified in 1.


There is a nav-bar at the bottom of our page which will allow you to navigate between the invitations page,
responses page, and settings.

If you click on the invitations page, you will be directed a list of inv
