# HomeShare README

## Creating Virtual Emulator
To run our app, you must first create an emulator by selecting menu “Tools => Device Manager” and choose “Pixel 2.”
Once you click "Pixel 2," you must choose “Nougat API 24 Android 7.0 x86” when told to "Select a System Image."
Now your emulator is set up and you can run the app on your AVD by  clicking “Run ‘app’” command from the “Run” menu.

## Using HomeShare
Before running our app for the first time, press "Files => Sync Project with Gradle Files"
Now that our app is running on your virtual emulator, you must first create an account using your name and email.
You can also login with Google to use our application.
Also, if you create an account without logging in through Google and log in with Google the next time, our app will
automatically merge the account login data so that you can use either login method to access your account.

## Creating an Account and Profile
Once you have created an account, you will be directed to create a profile which is mandatory.
You will be required to put in your full name, email, gender, class standing, profile picture, and a biography.
All of these can be updated/edited at any time you would like.

## The Nav-Bar
There is a nav-bar at the bottom of our page which will allow you to navigate between the invitations page,
responses page, and settings.

## Invitations Page Directions
Now that you have completed creating an account and profile, you will be directed to the invitations page.
On the invitations page, you can see a list of invitations you have received as well as the invitations you have sent.
You will also have the freedom to be able to create more invitations to send others as well as edit invitations you may have sent. \
Some features of invitations page are: \
&emsp; &emsp;1. Clicking on any part of a invitation card except for the buttons will create a popup to show you more information about an invitation that was sent to you. \
&emsp; &emsp;2. Clicking on the message button on the invitation card will create a popup, allowing you to message and response the user who invited you, indicating that you have accepted their invitation. This will remove all other invitations from your invitations page, except for the ones you have created. \
&emsp; &emsp;3. Clicking on the remove button on an invitation card will remove that invitation off your list of invites, indicating that you have rejected the invitation. If you move to another page and come back, the invitation that you rejected will no longer be there. \

"Number of Bedrooms", "Number of Bathrooms", "Price (filter by maximum)", "Number of Roommates", "Deadline Year YYYY (filter before)", or "Year Posted YYYY (filter before)". \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;2. Sort the above in "ascending" or "descending" order. \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;3. Search bar will allow you to put in an input depending on what you select from the list of filter types specified in 1.

## Responses Page Directions
On the Nav-Bar, if you click on the responses tab, you will be directed to the responses page where you can see responses you have recieved from your invitations that you sent out. \
Some features of responses page are: \

&emsp; &emsp;2. Clicking on the message button on a response card will create a popup, allowing you to message back the user that you sent an invite to. This will then remove the response from your response feed if you leave the response page and come back to it. \
