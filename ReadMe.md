Creating Virtual Emulator
To run our app, you must first create an emulator by selecting menu “Tools => Device Manager” and choosing “Pixel 2.”
Once you click "Pixel 2," you must choose “Nougat API 24 Android 7.0 x86” when told to "Select a System Image."
Now your emulator is set up and you can run the app on your AVD by  clicking “Run ‘app’” command from the “Run” menu.

Now that our app is running on your virtual emulator, you must first create an account or login with Google to be able to use 
our application.
